# Git-CodeBuild-Terraform

This was a lesson about automation with AWS Codebuild:
* We created a small Terrafom template using an official module. We combined this with an S3 backend.
* Then we included some shell scripts that were executed via the buildspec.yaml file.
* We combined this with GitHub (using access tokens) and AWS CodeBuild.
